# ðŸ¤– Flipkart E-commerce Chatbot

## Objective
To build an intelligent chatbot for Flipkart that:
- **Answers customer FAQs** using semantic search + LLM (Large Language Models).
- **Provides product recommendations** by interpreting natural language queries, converting them into SQL, and displaying results conversationally.

## Deployment Platform
- **Frontend**: Built and deployed using **Streamlit**

## Functionality Overview
### 1. Dual Mode Bot
The chatbot serves two main purposes:
- **FAQ Mode**: 
  Answers questions such as:
  - "Do you support Cash on Delivery (COD)?"
  - "What is the return policy?"
  
- **Product Query Mode**:
  Provides product details like:
  - "Show me top 3 Nike shoes with rating > 4 and more than 500 reviews"

### 2. Data Sources and Storage
#### A. Product Data
- **Source**: Scraped from [Flipkart - Shoes Category]
- **Columns Captured**:
  - `product_link`
  - `title`
  - `brand`
  - `price`
  - `discount`
  - `avg_rating`
  - `total_ratings`
  
- **Storage**:
  - Initially saved to a **CSV** file
  - Then loaded into a **SQLite** database (`products` table)

#### B. FAQs
- **Stored in ChromaDB**
  - Each FAQ includes:
    - `question` (used for semantic similarity)
    - `answer` (stored as metadata)
  - Supports **semantic search** to find the most relevant question

## Bot Workflow
### Step 1: Semantic Router
LLM-based classification of user queries into categories:
- **FAQ**
- **Product (SQL)**

### Step 2: FAQ Flow
1. **User query** â†’ Semantic similarity search against stored FAQs
2. **Matched answer + original query** â†’ Passed to LLM
3. **Final conversational response** generated and displayed in the chatbot

### Step 3: Product Flow
1. **User query** (e.g., "top 3 Nike shoes...") â†’ Passed to LLM
2. **LLM generates SQL query**, for example:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products
   WHERE brand LIKE '%nike%'
     AND avg_rating > 4
     AND total_ratings > 500
   ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
   LIMIT 3;
3. Query is executed on the SQLite database
4. Results + original query â†’ Passed to LLM
5. Final conversational response generated for chatbot display
